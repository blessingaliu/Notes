# ðŸš€ My notes for Makers Week 2

## Skills I want to achieve this week

- Understanding object orientated relationships (encapsulation and cohesion)
- Code reviews
- Domain model diagramming



# Code Reviews

High quality code 

- Code that is easily readable
- Code that passes the requirement specifications
- Code is structured and indented properly
- Code that is not repeated or methods that only do one thing (single use responsibility

# Writing RSpec tests

# **[Step 1] Describe**

While writing any test the first thing you write is the describe block. Letâ€™s suppose we are writing test for a method calledÂ **play**Â inside aÂ **JukeBox**Â class. First describe block will contain the class name. Describe block helps you know what class/method you are writing test for.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

end
```

The next thing you write in describe is the method name

```ruby
describe JukeBox do 

 describe â€˜playâ€™ do  

 end

end
```

Note: If your class has just a single method and no more methods will be added in that class you can skip the method describe part.

# **[Step 2] Context**

Once the description about the method for which you are writing the test is there the next step would be to define the context. A method could work differently for different context.

Letâ€™s add two context for the method.

1. When user has inserted coin
2. When user has not inserted coin

```ruby
describe JukeBox do  

  describe â€˜playâ€™ do   

   context 'when user has inserted coin' do    
    end    

   context 'when user has not inserted coin' do    
   end  

 end

end
```

While writing context think about all the possible cases that could come in.

# **[Step 3] Scenario**

Now inside each context write the scenario what it should be doing. In our jukebox when a coin is inserted the jukeboxâ€™s play method should return â€˜a beautiful song for youâ€™ and when the user has not inserted a coin the jukebox should return â€˜no money no song :]â€™. So letâ€™s add them.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

  describe â€˜playâ€™ do

    context 'when user has inserted coin' do

      it 'return song being played message' do

      end

    end

    context 'when user has not inserted coin' do

      it 'return insert coin message' do

      end

    end

  end

end
```

# **[Step 4] Subject**

Subject is the main part of the test. Write down how you make the method call in a subject. Put the subject at the top so that you can reuse it across different context.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

  describe â€˜playâ€™ do
    subject(:play_music) { described_class.new(coin).play }

    context 'when user has inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { Coin.new(10) }

      it 'return song being played message' do

      end

    end

    context 'when user has not inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { FakeCoin.new(10) }

      it 'return insert coin message' do

      end

    end

  end
end
```

Notice that i have added coin variable inside each context since the only thing that changes in these two context is the coin. If you do not define the coin variable it will throw an error that the variable coin is not defined since it is in the used in subject of the test.

# **[Step 5] Mock/Stub**

Now mock/stub any external calls that you donâ€™t need to cover test for. There might be some other methods being called, or any external api calls or even database calls. Letâ€™s say this play method uses validate_coin method to know if the coin is valid or not.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

  describe â€˜.playâ€™ do
    subject(:play_music) { described_class.new(coin).play }

    context 'when user has inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { Coin.new(10) }

      before do
        allow(JukeBox).to_receive(:validate_coin)
          .with(coin).and_return(true)
      end

      it 'return song being played message' do

      end

    end

    context 'when user has not inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { FakeCoin.new(10) }

      before do
        allow(JukeBox).to_receive(:validate_coin)
          .with(coin).and_return(false)
      end

      it 'return insert coin message' do

      end

    end

  end

end
```

# **[Step 6] Expectation**

Now everything is set. The only thing remaining is to write the actual expectation.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

  describe â€˜playâ€™ do
    subject(:play_music) { described_class.new(coin).play }

    context 'when user has inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { Coin.new(10) }

      before do
        allow(JukeBox).to_receive(:validate_coin)
          .with(coin).and_return(true)
      end

      it 'return song being played message' do
        expect(play_music).to return('a beautiful song for you')
      end

    end

    context 'when user has not inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { FakeCoin.new(10) }

      before do
        allow(JukeBox).to_receive(:validate_coin)
          .with(coin).and_return(false)
      end

      it 'return insert coin message' do
        expect(play_music).to return('no money no song :]')
      end

    end

  end

end
```

All set. The test is now ready.

# **[Step 7] Refactor**

The test is now running well. There seems to be some code that would be reused. So letâ€™s use a variable and reuse the before each block.

```ruby
describe JukeBox do

  describe â€˜.playâ€™ do
    subject(:play_music) { described_class.new(coin).play }
 
    before do
      allow(JukeBox).to_receive(:validate_coin)
        .with(coin).and_return(valid)
    end

    context 'when user has inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { Coin.new(10) }
      let(:valid) { true }

      it 'return song being played message' do
        expect(play_music).to return('a beautiful song for you')
      end

    end

    context 'when user has not inserted coin' do
      let(:coin) { FakeCoin.new(10) }
      let(:valid) { false }

      it 'return insert coin message' do
        expect(play_music).to return('no money no song :]')
      end

    end

  end

end
```

With this there will be a fixed pattern of writing test. If all developers across the organisation follow the same structure it will be easy for all the developer to modify the code that someone else has written. Also if a developer wants to use a method that is already there, test helps to give the context what is the expected response of that method and what are the parameters that it takes.
